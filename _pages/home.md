Hello! I am a PhD Student in [Economics and Public Policy](https://fordschool.umich.edu/phd){:target="_blank"} at the University of Michigan and a Graduate Fellow in the Demography Training Program at the [Population Studies Center](https://psc.isr.umich.edu){:target="_blank"}. My research interests include development economics, labor economics, and the economics of innovation.
<br><br>
I previously worked as a Pre-Doctoral Fellow at Harvard Business School, where I researched topics related to the economics of innovation. I graduated from Duke University with a B.S. in Economics in 2020 and the London School of Economics with a M.S. in Economics in 2021.
