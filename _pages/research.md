[**Immigrant Entrepreneurship: New Estimates & A Research Agenda**](http://127.0.0.1:4000/files/Chodavadia_Kerr_Kerr_Maiden_NBERWP_2024_ImmigrantEntrepreneurshipNewEstimates.pdf){:target="_blank"}, [NBER Working Paper 32400](https://www.nber.org/papers/w32400) (2024) \
with [Sari Pekkala Kerr](https://www1.wellesley.edu/economics/faculty/kerrs){:target="_blank"}, [William Kerr](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=337265){:target="_blank"}, and Louis Maiden

<span style="font-size:.9em;">*Immigrants contribute disproportionately to entrepreneurship in many countries, accounting for a quarter of new employer businesses in the US. We review recent research on the measurement of immigrant entrepreneurship, the traits of immigrant founders, their economic impact, and policy levers. We provide updated statistics on the share of US entrepreneurs who are immigrants. We utilize the Annual Business Survey to quantify the greater rates of patenting and innovation in immigrant-founded firms. This higher propensity towards innovation is only partly explained by differences in education levels and fields of study. We conclude with avenues for future research.*</span>
